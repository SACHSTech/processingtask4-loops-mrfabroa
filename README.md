Demonstrate your learning objectives by using loops to reproduce the graphic above, such that:

* Quadrant 1 is a 10 x 10 grid that scales to with the size of window.
* Quadrant 2 is 5 x grid of evenly spaced circles that scales to the size of the window.
* Quadrant 3 is a horizontal grayscale gradient 
* Quadrant 4 is a 8 petal flower that uses a loop to draw the petals evenly spaced around the center of the flower.
